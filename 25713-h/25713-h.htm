<h1><big>THE JUDAS VALLEY</big></h1>

<h2>By GERALD VANCE</h2>

<div class="tease"><p><i>Why did everybody step off the ship in this strange valley
and promptly drop dead? How could a well-equipped corps of
tough spacemen become a field of rotting skeletons in this
quiet world of peace and contentment? It was a mystery Peter
and Sherri had to solve. If they could live long enough!</i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Peter Wayne</span> took the
letter out of the machine,
broke the seal, and examined
it curiously. It was an official
communication from the Interstellar
Exploration Service.
It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>FROM: Lieutenant General Martin Scarborough, I.E.S.<br />
TO: Captain Peter Wayne, Preliminary Survey Corps</p>

<p>Report immediately to
this office for assignment
to I.E.S. <i>Lord Nelson</i>. Full
briefing will be held at
2200 hours, 14 April 2103.</p>

<p class="rgt">By order of the Fleet Commandant.</p></div>

<p>It was short, brief, and to
the point. And it gave no information
whatsoever. Peter
Wayne shrugged resignedly,
put the letter down on his
bed, walked over to the phone,
and dialed a number.</p>

<p>A moment later, a girl's
face appeared&mdash;blonde-haired,
with high cheekbones, deep
blue-green eyes, and an expression
of the lips that
intriguingly combined desirability
and crisp military
bearing.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant James speaking,"
she said formally. Then,
as Wayne's image appeared
on her screen, she grinned.
"Hi, Pete. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Sherri," Wayne
said quickly. "I'm going to
have to cancel that date we
had for tomorrow night. I
just got my orders."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "I was
just going to call <i>you</i>, I got a
fac-sheet too. Looks as
though we won't see each
other for a while, Pete."</p>

<p>"What ship are you getting?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Lord Nelson</i>."</p>

<p>It was Wayne's turn to
laugh. "It looks as though we
<i>will</i> be seeing each other.
That's my ship too. We can
keep our date in the briefing
room."</p>

<p>Her face brightened.
"Good! I'll see you there,
then," she said. "I've got to
get my gear packed."</p>

<p>"Okay," Wayne said. "Let's
be on time, you know how
General Scarborough is."</p>

<p>She smiled. "Don't worry,
Peter. I'll be there. So long
for now."</p>

<p>"Bye, Sherri." He cut the
connection, watched the girl's
face melt away into a rainbow-colored
diamond of light,
and turned away. There were
a lot of things to do before he
would be ready to leave
Earth for an interstellar tour
of duty.</p>

<p>He wondered briefly as he
started to pack just what was
going on. There was usually
much more notice on any big
jump of this order. Something
special was up, he
thought, as he dragged his
duffle-bag out of the closet.</p>

<hr />

<p>He was at the briefing room
at 2158 on the nose. The Interstellar
Exploration Service
didn't much go for tardiness,
but they didn't pay extra if
you got there a half-hour early.
Captain Peter Wayne
made it a point of being at
any appointment two minutes
early&mdash;no more, no less.</p>

<p>The room was starting to
fill up, with men and women
Wayne knew well, had worked
with on other expeditions,
had lived with since he'd joined
the IES. They looked just
as puzzled as he probably did,
he saw; they knew they were
being called in on something
big, and in the IES big meant
<i>big</i>.</p>

<p>At precisely 2200, Lieutenant
General Scarborough
emerged from the inner office,
strode briskly up the aisle of
the briefing room, and took
his customary stance on the
platform in front. His face
looked stern, and he held his
hands clasped behind his
back. His royal blue uniform
was neat and trim. Over his
head, the second hand of the
big clock whirled endlessly. In
the silence of the briefing room,
it seemed to be ticking
much too loudly.</p>

<p>The general nodded curtly
and said, "Some of you are
probably wondering why the
order to report here wasn't
more specific. There are two
reasons for that. In the first
place, we have reason to believe
that we have found a
substantial deposit of double-nucleus
beryllium."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of
sound in the briefing room.
Wayne felt his heart starting
to pound; D-N beryllium <i>was</i>
big. So big that a whole fleet
of IES ships did nothing but
search the galaxy for it, full
time.</p>

<p>"Naturally," the general
continued, "we don't want
any of this information to
leak out, just in case it should
prove false. The prospect of
enough D-N beryllium to
make fusion power really
cheap could cause a panic if
we didn't handle it properly.
The Economics Board has
warned us that we'll have to
proceed carefully if there actually
is a big deposit on this
planet."</p>

<p>Captain Wayne stared uneasily
at Sherri James, who
frowned and chewed her lip.
To his left, a short, stubby
private named Manetti murmured
worriedly, "That
means trouble. D-N beryllium
always means trouble.
There's a catch somewhere."</p>

<p>General Scarborough, on
the platform, said, "There's
a second reason for secrecy.
I think it can better be explained
by a man who has the
evidence first-hand."</p>

<p>He paused and looked
around the room. "Four
weeks ago, the Scout Ship
<i>Mavis</i> came back from Fomalhaut
V." There was a
dead silence in the briefing
room.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Jervis, will you
tell the crew exactly what
happened on Fomalhaut V?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Lieutenant Jervis stepped
forward and took his place on
the platform. He was small
and wiry, with a hawk nose
and piercingly intense eyes.
He cleared his throat and
smiled a little sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I've told this story so
many times that it doesn't
even sound real to me any
more. I've told it to the Supreme
Senate Space Committee,
to half the top brass in
the IES, and to a Board of
Physicians from the Medical
Department.</p>

<p>"As well as I can remember
it, it goes something like
this."</p>

<p>Laughter rippled through
the room.</p>

<p>"We orbited around Fomalhaut
V for a Scouting
Survey," Jervis said. "The
planet is hot and rocky, but
it has a breathable atmosphere.
The detectors showed
various kinds of metals in the
crust, some of them in commercially
feasible concentration.
But the crust is so
mountainous and rocky that
there aren't very many places
to land a ship.</p>

<p>"Then we picked up the
double-nucleus beryllium deposit
on our detectors. Nearby,
there was a small, fairly
level valley, so we brought
the ship down for a closer
check. We wanted to make
absolutely positive that it was
double-nucleus beryllium before
we made our report."</p>

<p>He paused, as if arranging
the story he wanted to tell in
his mind, and went on. "The
D-N beryllium deposit lies at
the top of a fairly low mountain
about five miles from the
valley. We triangulated it
first, and then we decided we
ought to send up a party to
get samples of the ore if it
were at all possible.</p>

<p>"I was chosen to go, along
with another member of the
crew, a man named Lee Bellows.
We left the ship at
about five in the morning, and
spent most of the day climbing
up to the spot where we
had detected the beryllium.
We couldn't get a sample; the
main deposit is located several
feet beneath the surface
of the mountaintop, and the
mountain is too rough and
rocky to climb without special
equipment. We got less than
halfway before we had to
stop."</p>

<p>Wayne felt Sherri nudge
him, and turned to nod. He
knew what she was thinking.
This was where he came in;
it was a job that called for a
specialist, a trained mountaineer&mdash;such
as Captain Peter
Wayne. He frowned and
turned his attention back to
the man on the platform.</p>

<hr />

<p>"We made all the readings
we could," Jervis continued.
"Then we headed back to our
temporary base."</p>

<p>His face looked troubled.
"When we got back, every
man at the base was dead."</p>

<p>Silence in the room. Complete,
utter, deafening silence.</p>

<p>"There were only nine of
us in the ship," Jervis said.
He was obviously still greatly
affected by whatever had taken
place on Fomalhaut V.
"With seven of us dead, that
left only Bellows and myself.
We couldn't find out what had
killed them. They were lying
scattered over the valley floor
for several yards around the
ship. They looked as though
they had suddenly dropped
dead at whatever they were
doing."</p>

<p>Peter Wayne made use of
his extra few inches of height
to glance around the briefing
room. He saw row on row of
tense faces&mdash;faces that reflected
the same emotions he
was feeling. Space exploration
was something still new
and mostly unknown, and
even the experienced men of
IES still knew fear occasionally.
The galaxy was a big
place; unknown terrors lurked
on planets unimaginably
distant. Every now and then,
something like this would
come up&mdash;something to give
you pause, before you ventured
into space again.</p>

<p>"We couldn't find out what
had killed them," Jervis said
again. "They were lying scattered
every which way, with
no clues at all." The small
man's fingers were trembling
from relived fright. "Bellows
and I were pretty scared, I'll
have to admit. We couldn't
find a sign of what had killed
the men&mdash;they'd just&mdash;just
<i>died</i>."</p>

<p>There was a quiver in his
voice. It was obvious he could
never take the story lightly,
no matter how many times he
had to tell it.</p>

<p>Wayne heard Private Manetti
mutter, "There's always
a price for D-N beryllium."</p>

<p>"The Scout Ship hadn't
been molested," Jervis went
on. "I went inside and checked
it over. It was untouched,
undisturbed in every way.
I checked the control panel,
the cabins, everything. All
unbothered. The ship was
empty and dead. And&mdash;outside&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I came out, Bellows
was dead too." He took a deep
breath. "I'm afraid I panicked
then. I locked myself inside
the ship, set the autocontrols,
and headed back to
Earth at top velocity. I set
the ship in an orbit around
the moon and notified headquarters.
I was quarantined
immediately, of course, to
make sure I wasn't carrying
anything. The medics checked
me over carefully. I wasn't
and am not now carrying any
virus or bacteria unknown to
Terrestrial medicine.</p>

<p>"Since I'm the only one
who knows exactly where this
valley is, the general has
asked me to guide the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> to the exact spot. Actually,
it could be found eventually
with the D-N beryllium
as a guide. But the <i>Mavis</i> was
in orbit around Fomalhaut V
for two weeks before we
found the D-N beryllium deposit,
and the Service feels
that we shouldn't waste any
time."</p>

<p>The lieutenant sat down,
and General Scarborough resumed
his place on the platform.</p>

<hr />

<p>"That's the situation,"
Scarborough said bluntly.
"You know the setup, now&mdash;and
I think some of you see
how your specialities are going
to fit into the operation.
As Lieutenant Jervis pointed
out, we don't know what killed
the crew of the <i>Mavis</i>;
therefore, we are going to
take every possible precaution.
As far as we know,
there are no inimical life
forms on Fomalhaut V&mdash;but
it's possible that there are
things we don't know about,
such as airborne viruses that
kill in a very short time. If
so, then Lieutenant Jervis is
immune to the virus and is
not a transmitter or carrier
of it.</p>

<p>"However, to guard against
such a possibility, no one will
leave the <i>Lord Nelson</i>, once it
has landed, without wearing
a spacesuit. The air is breathable,
but we're taking no
chances. Also, no one will go
out alone; scouting parties
will always be in pairs, with
wide open communication
with the ship. And at no time
will more than ten percent of
the ship's company be outside
at any one time."</p>

<p>Wayne made a rough mental
computation. <i>The</i> Lord
Nelson <i>holds sixty. That
means no more than six out
at any single time. They really
must be worried.</i></p>

<p>"Aside from those orders,
which were decided on by the
Service Command, you'll be
under the direct orders of
Colonel Nels Petersen. Colonel
Petersen."</p>

<p>Petersen was a tall, hard-faced
man with a touch of
gray at his temples. He stepped
forward and stared intently
at the assembled crew.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Our job is to make the
preliminary preparations for
getting D-N beryllium out of
the crust of Fomalhaut V.
We're supposed to stay alive
while we do it. Therefore, our
secondary job is to find out
what it was that killed the
scouting expedition of the
<i>Mavis</i>. There are sixty of us
going aboard the <i>Lord Nelson</i>
tomorrow, and I'd like to
have sixty aboard when we
come back. Got that?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward,
stretched upward on his toes,
and smiled mechanically.
"Fine. Now, you all know
your jobs, but we're going to
have to work together as a
team. We're going to have to
correlate our work so that
we'll know what we're doing.
So don't think we won't have
anything to do during the two
weeks it will take us to get to
Fomalhaut V. We're going to
work it as though it were a
shakedown cruise. If anyone
doesn't work out, he'll be replaced,
even if we have to
turn around and come back to
Earth. On a planet which has
wiped out a whole scouting
expedition, we can't afford to
have any slip-ups. And that
means we can't afford to have
anyone aboard who doesn't
know what he's doing or
doesn't care. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>"All right," said the colonel.
"Let's go out and get
acquainted with the <i>Lord
Nelson</i>."</p>

<hr />

<p>The briefing session broke
up well past midnight, and
the group that shortly would
become the crew of the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> filtered out of the
building and into the cool
spring air. Each man had a
fairly good idea of his job
and each man knew the dangers
involved. No one had
backed out.</p>

<p>"What d'ye think of it,
Pete?" Sherri James asked,
as they left together. "Sounds
pretty mean."</p>

<p>"I wish we knew what the
answers were beforehand,"
Wayne said. He glanced
down at Sherri. The moon
was full, and its rays glinted
brightly off her golden hair.
"It's a risky deal, as Petersen
said. Nine men go out, and
eight die&mdash;of what? Just
dead, that's all."</p>

<p>"It's the way the game
goes," Sherri said. "You
knew that when you joined
the corps." They turned down
the main road of the IES
compound and headed for the
snack bar.</p>

<p>Wayne nodded. "I know,
kid. It's a job, and it has to
be done. But nobody likes to
walk into an empty planet
like that knowing that eight
of the last nine guys who did
didn't come back."</p>

<p>He put his arm around her
and they entered the snack
bar that way. Most of the
other crew-members were
there already; Wayne sensed
the heightening tenseness on
their faces.</p>

<p>"Two nuclear fizzes," he
said to the pfc at the bar.
"With all the trimmings."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Captain?"
said a balding, potbellied
major a few stools down,
who was nursing a beer.
"How come the soft drinks
tonight, Wayne?"</p>

<p>Peter grinned. "I'm in
training, Major Osborne.
Gotta kill the evil green
horde from Rigel Seven, and
I don't dare drink anything
stronger than sarsaparilla."</p>

<p>"How about the amazon,
then?" Osborne said, gesturing
at Sherri. "Her too?"</p>

<p>"Me too," Sherri said.</p>

<p>Osborne stared at his beer.
"You two must be in Scarborough's
new project, then."
He squinted at Peter, who
nodded almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"You'll need luck," Osborne
said.</p>

<p>"No we won't," Wayne
said. "Not luck. We'll need
more than just luck to pull us
through."</p>

<p>The nuclear fizzes arrived.
He began to sip it quietly. A
few more members of the
crew entered the snack bar.
Their faces were drawn
tensely.</p>

<p>He guzzled the drink and
looked up at Sherri, who was
sucking down the last of the
soda. "Let's get going, Lieutenant
James. The noncoms
are coming, and we don't
want them to make nasty remarks
about us."</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>Lord Nelson</i> blasted off
the next evening, after a
frenzied day of hurried preparations.
The crew of sixty
filed solemnly aboard, Colonel
Petersen last, and the great
hatch swung closed.</p>

<p>There was the usual routine
loudspeaker-business
while everyone quickly and
efficiently strapped into his
acceleration cradle, and then
the ship leaped skyward. It
climbed rapidly, broke free of
Earth's grasp, and, out past
the moon, abruptly winked
out of normal space into overdrive.
It would spend the next
two weeks in hyperspace,
short-cutting across the galaxy
to Fomalhaut V.</p>

<p>It was a busy two weeks
for everyone involved. Captain
Peter Wayne, as a central
part of the team, spent
much of his time planning his
attack. His job would be the
actual climbing of the mountain
where the double-nucleus
beryllium was located. It
wasn't going to be an easy
job; the terrain was rough,
the wind, according to Jervis,
whipped ragingly through the
hills, and the jagged peaks
thrust into the air like the
teeth of some mythical
dragon.</p>

<p>Study of the three-dimensional
aerial photographs
taken from the <i>Mavis</i> showed
that the best route was
probably up through one end
of the valley, through a narrow
pass that led around the
mountain, and up the west
slope, which appeared to offer
better handholds and was less
perpendicular than the other
sides of the mountain.</p>

<p>This time, the expedition
would have the equipment to
make the climb. There were
ropes, picks, and crampons,
and sets of metamagnetic
boots and grapples. With
metamagnetic boots, Wayne
thought, they'd be able to
walk up the side of the mountain
almost as easily as if it
were flat.</p>

<p>He studied the thick, heavy
soles of the boots for a moment,
then set to work polishing.
Wayne liked to keep his
boots mirror-bright; it wasn't
required, but it was a habit
of his nonetheless.</p>

<p>He set to work vigorously.
Everyone aboard the ship was
working that way. Sherri
James, who was in charge of
the Correlation Section, had
noticed the same thing the
day before. Her job was to
co-ordinate all the information
from various members
of the expedition, run them
through the computers, and
record them. She had been
busy since blastoff, testing
the computers, checking and
rechecking them, being overly
efficient.</p>

<p>"I know why we're doing
it," she said. "It keeps our
mind off the end of the trip.
When we spend the whole day
working out complicated circuits
for the computers, or
polishing mountain boots, or
cleaning the jet tubes, it's just
so we don't have to think
about Fomalhaut V. It helps
to concentrate on details."</p>

<p>Wayne nodded and said
nothing. Sherri was right.
There was one thought in
everyone's mind: what was
the deadly secret of the valley?</p>

<p>There was another thought,
after that:</p>

<p><i>Will we find it out in time?</i></p>

<hr />

<p>After two weeks of flight
through the vast blackness of
interstellar space, the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> came out of overdrive
and set itself in an orbit
around Fomalhaut V. Lieutenant
Jervis, the sole survivor
of the ill-fated <i>Mavis</i>,
located the small valley between
the giant crags that
covered the planet, and the
huge spherical bulk of the
spaceship settled gently to
the floor of the valley.</p>

<p>They were gathered in the
central room of the ship
ten minutes after the <i>all-clear</i>
rang through the corridors,
informing everyone that the
landing had been safely accomplished.
From the portholes
they could see the white
bones of the <i>Mavis's</i> crew lying
on the reddish sand of
the valley bottom.</p>

<p>"There they are," Jervis
said quietly. "Just bones.
Those were my shipmates."</p>

<p>Wayne saw Sherri repress
a shudder. Little heaps of
bones lay here and there on
the sand, shining brightly in
the hot sun. That was the
crew of the <i>Mavis</i>&mdash;or what
was left of them.</p>

<p>Colonel Petersen entered
the room and confronted the
crew. "We're here," he said.
"You know the schedule from
now on. No one's to leave the
ship until we've made a check
outside, and after that&mdash;assuming
it's OK to go out&mdash;no
more than six are to leave
the ship at any one time."</p>

<p>He pointed to a row of
metal magnetic tabs clinging
to the wall nearest the corridor
that led to the airlock.
"When you go out, take one
of those tabs and touch it on
your suit. There are exactly
six tabs. If none are there,
don't go out. It's as simple as
that."</p>

<p>Four men in spacesuits entered
the room, followed by
two others. The leader of the
group saluted. "We're ready,
sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Go out and get a look at
the bodies," the colonel told
the men, who were Medical
Corpsmen. "You know the
procedure. Air and sand
samples too, of course."</p>

<p>The leader saluted again,
turned, and left. Wayne
watched the six spacesuited
figures step one at a time to
the wall, withdraw one of the
metal tabs, and affix it to the
outer skin of his suit. Then
they went outside.</p>

<p>Captain Wayne and Sherri
James stood by one of the
portholes and watched the six
medics as they bent over the
corpses outside. "I don't get
it, I just don't understand,"
Wayne said quietly.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What don't you get?"
Sherri asked.</p>

<p>"Those skeletons. Those
men have only been dead for
two months, and they've been
reduced to nothing but bones
already. Even the fabric of
their clothing is gone. Why?
There must be something
here that causes human flesh
to deteriorate much faster
than normal."</p>

<p>"It does look pretty gruesome,"
Sherri agreed. "I'm
glad we've been ordered to
keep our spacesuits on. I
wouldn't want to be exposed
to anything that might be out
there."</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;" Wayne muttered.</p>

<p>"What? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Wayne pointed to one figure
lying on the sand. "See
that? What's that over his
head?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;it's a space helmet!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Wayne. "The
question is: was he wearing
just the helmet, or the whole
suit? If he was wearing the
whole suit, we're not going to
be as well protected as we
thought, even with our fancy
suits."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed
slowly before the medics returned,
and five minutes more
before they had passed
through the decontamination
chambers and were allowed
into the ship proper. A ring
of tense faces surrounded
them as they made their report.</p>

<hr />

<p>The leader, a tall, bespectacled
doctor named Stevelman,
was the spokesman. He
shrugged when Colonel Petersen
put forth the question
whose answer everyone waited
for.</p>

<p>"I don't know," the medic
replied. "I don't know what
killed them. There's dry bones
out there, but no sign of anything
that might have done it.
It's pretty hard to make a
quick diagnosis on a skeleton,
Colonel."</p>

<p>"What about the one skeleton
with the bubble helmet?"
Peter Wayne asked. "Did you
see any sign of a full suit on
him?"</p>

<p>Stevelman shook his head.
"Not a sign, sir."</p>

<p>Colonel Petersen turned
and glanced at Lieutenant
Jervis. "Do you remember
what the circumstances were,
Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>Jervis shrugged. "I don't
recall it very clearly, sir. I
honestly couldn't tell you
whether they were wearing
suits or bubble-helmets or
anything. I was too upset at
the time to make careful observations."</p>

<p>"I understand," Petersen
said.</p>

<p>But the medic had a different
theory. He pointed at Jervis
and said, "That's a point
I've meant to make, Lieutenant.
You're a trained space
scout. Your psychological
records show that you're not
the sort of man given to panic
or to become confused."</p>

<p>"Are you implying that
there's something improper
about my statement, Dr.
Stevelman?"</p>

<p>The medic held up a hand.
"Nothing of the sort, Lieutenant.
But since you're not
the sort to panic, even in such
a crisis as the complete destruction
of the entire crew
of your scout ship, you must
have been ill&mdash;partly delirious
from fever. Not delirious
enough to cause hallucinations,
but just enough to impair
your judgment."</p>

<p>Jervis nodded. "That is
possible," he said.</p>

<p>"Good," said Stevelman. "I
have two tentative hypotheses,
then." He turned to
the colonel. "Should I state
them now, Colonel Petersen?"</p>

<p>"There's to be no secrecy
aboard this ship, Doctor. I
want every man and woman
on the ship to know all the
facts at all times."</p>

<p>"Very well," the medic said.
"I'd suggest the deaths were
caused by some unknown virus&mdash;or,
perhaps, by some
virulent poison that occurred
occasionally, a poisonous
smog of some kind that had
settled in the valley for a
time and then dissipated."</p>

<p>Wayne frowned and shook
his head. Both hypotheses
made sense.</p>

<p>"Do you have any suggestions,
Doctor?" Petersen said.</p>

<p>"Since we don't have any
direct information about why
those men died, Colonel, I
can't make any definite statements.
But I can offer one bit
of advice to everyone: <i>wear
your suits and be alert</i>."</p>

<hr />

<p>During the week that followed,
several groups went
out without suffering any ill
effects. A short service was
held for the eight of the <i>Mavis</i>
and then the skeletons were
buried in the valley.</p>

<p>They ran a check on the
double-nucleus beryllium toward
the end of the week,
after it had been fairly safely
established that no apparent
harm was going to come to
them. Wayne and Sherri were
both in the crew that went
outside to set up the detector.</p>

<p>"You man the detector
plate," said Major MacDougal,
who was in charge of the
group, turning to Wayne.</p>

<p>He put his hand on the
plate and waited for the guide
coordinates to be set. MacDougal
fumbled at the base
of the detector for a moment,
and the machine began picking
up eloptic radiations.</p>

<p>Wayne now looked down at
the detector plate. "Here we
are," he said. "The dial's oscillating
between four and eight,
all right. The stuff's here."</p>

<p>MacDougal whistled gently.
"It's really sending, isn't
it!" He pointed toward the
mountaintop. "From up
there, too. It's going to be a
nice climb. Okay, pack the detector
up and let's get back
inside."</p>

<p>They entered the airlock
and passed on into the ship.</p>

<p>"The D-N beryllium up
there, sir," Major MacDougal
said. "It's going to be a devil
of a job to get up to find the
stuff."</p>

<p>"That's what Captain
Wayne's here for," Petersen
said. "Captain, what do you
think? Can you get up here?"</p>

<p>"It would have been easier
to bring along a helicopter,"
Wayne said wryly. "Pity the
things don't fit into spaceships.
But I think I can get
up there. I'd like to try surveying
the lay of the land,
first. I want to know all the
possible routes before I start
climbing."</p>

<p>"Good idea," Petersen said.
"I'll send you out with three
men to do some preliminary
exploring. Boggs! Manetti!
MacPherson! Suit up and get
with it!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Wayne strode toward the
spacesuit locker, took out his
suit, and donned it. Instead
of the normal space boots, he
put on the special metamagnetic
boots for mountain
climbing. The little reactors
in the back of the calf activated
the thick metal sole of
each boot so that it would
cling tightly to the metallic
rock of the mountain. Unlike
ordinary magnetism, the metamagnetic
field acted on all
metals, even when they were
in combination with other
elements.</p>

<p>His team of three stood before
him in the airlock room.
He knew all three of them
fairly well from Earthside;
they were capable, level-headed
men, and at least one&mdash;Boggs&mdash;had
already been out
in the valley surveying once,
and so knew the area pretty
well.</p>

<p>He pulled on the boots and
looked up. "We're not going
to climb the mountain this
time, men. We'll just take a
look around it to decide which
is the best way."</p>

<p>"You have any ideas, sir?"
Sergeant Boggs asked.</p>

<p>"From looking at the photographs,
I'd guess that the
western approach is the best.
But I may be wrong. Little
details are hard to see from
five hundred miles up, even
with the best of instruments,
and there may be things in
our way that will make the
west slope impassible. If so,
we'll try the southern side. It
looks pretty steep, but it also
seems rough enough to offer
plenty of handholds."</p>

<p>"Too bad we couldn't have
had that helicopter you were
talking about," said Boggs.</p>

<p>Wayne grinned. "With
these winds? They'd smash us
against the side of the mountain
before we'd get up fifty
feet. You ought to know, Sergeant&mdash;you've
been out in
them once already."</p>

<p>"They're not so bad down
in this valley, sir," Boggs
said. "The only time you really
notice them is when you
climb the escarpment at the
northern end. They get pretty
rough up there."</p>

<p>Wayne nodded. "You can
see what kind of a job we'll
have. Even with metamagnetic
boots and grapples, we'll
still have to use the old standbys."
He looked at the men.
"Okay; we're all ready. Let's
go."</p>

<p>They unhooked four of the
six tabs from the wall and
donned them. Then they moved
on into the airlock and
closed the inner door. The air
was pumped out, just as
though the ship were in space
or on a planet with a poisonous
atmosphere. As far as
anyone knew, the atmosphere
of Fomalhaut V actually was
poisonous. Some of the tension
had relaxed after a week
spent in safety, but there was
always the first expedition to
consider; no one took chances.</p>

<p>When all the air had been
removed, a bleeder valve allowed
the outer air to come
into the chamber. Then the
outer door opened, and the
four men went down the ladder
to the valley floor.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wayne led the way across
the sand in silence. The four
men made their way toward
the slope on the western side
of the valley. Overhead, the
bright globe of Fomalhaut
shed its orange light over the
rugged landscape.</p>

<p>When they reached the beginning
of the slope, Wayne
stopped and looked upwards.
"Doesn't look easy," he grunted.
"Damned rough hill, matter
of fact. MacPherson, do
you think you could make it
to the top?"</p>

<p>Corporal MacPherson was
a small, wiry man who had
the reputation of being a
first-rank mountaineer. He
had been a member of the
eighteenth Mount Everest
Party, and had been the second
of that party to reach the
summit of the towering peak.</p>

<p>"Sure I can, sir," he said
confidently. "Shall I take the
rope?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. You and Manetti
get the rope to the top,
and Sergeant Boggs and I
will follow up."</p>

<p>"Righto, sir."</p>

<p>Corporal MacPherson
reached his gloved hands forward
and contracted his fingers.
The tiny microswitches
in his gloves actuated the relays,
and his hands clung to
the rock. Then he put his
boots against the wall and began
to move up the steep escarpment.</p>

<p>Private Manetti followed
after him. The two men were
lashed together by the light
plastisteel cable. The sergeant
held the end of the cable in
his hands, waiting for the coil
to be paid out.</p>

<p>Wayne watched the two
men climb, while a chill wind
whipped down out of the
mountains and raised the
sand in the valley. It was less
than eighty feet to the precipice
edge above, but it was
almost perpendicular, and as
they climbed, the buffeting
winds began to press against
their bodies with ever-increasing
force.</p>

<p>They reached the top and
secured the rope, and then
they peered over the edge and
signalled that Wayne and the
sergeant should start up.</p>

<p>"We're coming," Wayne
shouted, and returned the signal.
It was at that instant
that he felt something slam
against the sole of his heavy
metamagnetic boot. It was as
though something had kicked
him savagely on the sole of
his right foot.</p>

<p>He winced sharply at the
impact. Then, somewhat puzzled
he looked down at the
boot. He felt something move
under the sand. He tried to
step back, and almost tripped.
It was as though his right
foot were stuck firmly to the
sand!</p>

<p>He pushed himself back,
and with a tremendous heave
managed to pull himself free.
He braced his body against
the cliff, lifted his foot, and
looked at it.</p>

<p>Hanging from his boot sole
was one of the ugliest monstrosities
he had ever seen,
unusually grotesque.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was about the size and
shape of a regulation football,
and was covered with a
wrinkled, reddish hide. At one
end was a bright red gash of
a mouth studded with greenish,
gnashing teeth. From the
other end of the creature's
body protruded a long, needle-like
projection which had imbedded
itself in the metal sole
of Wayne's boot.</p>

<p>"Good God! If I'd been
wearing ordinary boots, that
thing would have stuck clear
into my foot!"</p>

<p>He hefted the weighted
pick with one hand and
swung, catching the monster
with the point. It sank in and
ripped through the creature,
spilling red-orange blood over
the sand. Shuddering a little,
Wayne put his other foot on
the dead thing and pulled his
right boot free of the needle
beak.</p>

<p>He started to say something,
but he had a sudden
premonition that made him
look up in time. Sergeant
Boggs put both hands against
the Captain's shoulder and
pushed.</p>

<p>"What the hell?" Wayne
asked in surprise as he felt
the shove. He almost fell to
the sand, but he had had just
enough warning to allow him
to keep his balance. He put
out a foot and staggered
wildly.</p>

<p>A sudden strange noise
caused him to turn and look
back. Five needles were jabbing
viciously up out of the
sand in the spot where he
would have fallen.</p>

<p>"You out of your head,
Boggs?" he started to ask&mdash;but
before the last word was
out of his mouth, the sergeant
charged in madly and tried to
push him over again. He was
fighting like a man gone berserk&mdash;which
he was.</p>

<p>Wayne grabbed him by the
wrist and flipped him desperately
aside. The sergeant fell,
sprawled out for a moment
on the sand, then bounced to
his feet again. His eyes were
alight with a strange, terrifying
flame.</p>

<p>Silently, he leaped for
Wayne. The captain slammed
his fist forward, sending it
crashing into Boggs's midsection.
The sergeant came back
with a jab to the stomach that
pushed Wayne backward.
Again the deadly needles
flicked up from the ground,
but they did not strike home.</p>

<p>Wayne gasped for breath
and reached out for Boggs.
Boggs leaped on him, trying
to push Wayne down where
the beaks could get to him.
Wayne sidestepped, threw
Boggs off balance, and clubbed
down hard with his fist.</p>

<p>Boggs wandered dizzily for
a second before Wayne's other
fist came blasting in, knocking
the breath out of him. A
third blow, and the sergeant
collapsed on the sand.</p>

<p>Wayne paused and caught
his breath. The sergeant remained
unconscious. Wayne
shook his head uncertainly,
wondering what had come
over the mild-mannered
Boggs. A chilling thought
struck him: <i>was this what
happened to the crew of the
Mavis?</i></p>

<hr />

<p>He looked up the cliff,
where the other two men
were still peering over the
edge.</p>

<p>"MacPherson! Manetti!
Come down! We're going
back to the ship!"</p>

<p>He heaved the unconscious
body of Sergeant Boggs over
his shoulder like a potato-sack,
and waited for the two
men to come down. They
drew near.</p>

<p>"Boggs must have gone out
of his head," Wayne said. "He
jumped me like a madman."</p>

<p>They had nothing to say, so
he turned and began to trudge
back to the <i>Lord Nelson</i>, trying
to assemble the facts in
his mind. They followed
alongside.</p>

<p>What was behind the attack?
After seeing the monster,
why had Boggs attempted
to push his superior officer
over into the sand? There
were other little beasts under
that sand; why would Boggs
want one of them&mdash;there
seemed to be dozens&mdash;to jab
him with its needle of a beak?</p>

<p>And what were the beastly
little animals, anyway?</p>

<p>There were no answers.
But the answers would have
to come, soon.</p>

<p>He tossed Boggs into the
airlock and waited for the
others to catch up. They
climbed up the ladder and
said nothing as the airlock
went through its cycle and
the antibacterial spray covered
them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Colonel Petersen looked at
him across the desk and put
the palms of his hands together.
"Then, as I understand
it, Captain, Sergeant
Boggs tried to push you over
into the sand when this&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>monster</i>
jabbed you in the
foot?"</p>

<p>"That's right, sir," Wayne
said. He felt uncomfortable.
This wasn't a formal court-martial;
it was simply an inquiry
into the sergeant's
actions. Charges would be
preferred later, if there were
any to be preferred.</p>

<p>Sergeant Boggs stood
stolidly on the far side of the
room. A livid bruise along his
jaw testified to the struggle
that had taken place. One eye
was puffed, and his expression
was an unhappy one.
Near him, MacPherson and
Private Manetti stood stiffly
at attention.</p>

<p>The colonel looked at
Boggs. "What's your side of
the story, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>The non-com's face didn't
change. "Sir, the captain's
statement isn't true."</p>

<p>"<i>What's that?</i>" Wayne
asked angrily.</p>

<p>"Quiet, Captain," Petersen
said. "Go ahead, Boggs."</p>

<p>The sergeant licked his
bruised lips. "I was about to
start up the rope when, for
no reason at all, he struck
me in the stomach. Then he
hit me again a few more
times, and I passed out."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything when
he did this?" the Colonel
asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Wayne frowned. What was
the sergeant trying to do?
What the devil was he up to?</p>

<p>"Corporal MacPherson,"
the colonel said, "Did
you witness the fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the small man
said, stepping a pace forward.</p>

<p>"Describe it."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we were up on
top of the cliff, and we called&mdash;or
rather, <i>I</i> called for the
captain and the sergeant to
come on up. Sergeant Boggs
took a hold of the rope and
then the captain hit him in
the belly, sir. He hit him
twice more and the sergeant
fell down. Then the captain
told us to come down, which
we did, sir. That was all." He
gestured with his hands to indicate
he had no more to say.</p>

<p>Wayne could hardly believe
his ears. Making an effort, he
managed to restrain himself.</p>

<p>"Private Manetti, do you
have anything to add to
that?" the colonel asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir. It happened just
like that, sir. We both seen
the entire thing. That's the
way it happened. The captain
hauled off and let him
have it."</p>

<p>The colonel swivelled
around and let his cold eyes
rest on Wayne. "Captain, you
have stated that Sergeant
Boggs did not talk to either
of these two men after you
struck him. That eliminates
any collusion."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Wayne said
stonily.</p>

<p>"I talked to both men separately,
and they tell substantially
the same story. The
records of all three of these
men are excellent. The sergeant
claims he never saw
any monster of the type you
describe, and the group I sent
out to check says that there
is no body of any alien animal
anywhere near the spot. How
do you explain the discrepancies
between your story and
theirs?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Wayne glared angrily at
the three men. "They're lying,
sir," he said evenly. "I
don't know why they're doing
it. The whole thing took place
exactly as I told you."</p>

<p>"I find that very difficult to
believe, Captain."</p>

<p>"Is that a formal accusation,
sir?"</p>

<p>Petersen shrugged and
rubbed his hands against his
iron-grey temples. "Captain,"
he said finally, "you have a
very fine record. You have
never before been known to
strike an enlisted man for
any cause whatever. I hold
that in your favor."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"On the other hand, the
evidence here definitely indicates
that your story is not
quite true. Now, we know
that Lieutenant Jervis acted
peculiarly after the crew of
the <i>Mavis</i> met its mysterious
end, and the Medical Corps
thinks that whatever is causing
the deaths could also
cause mental confusion.
Therefore, I am remanding
you to the custody of the
Medical Corps for observation.
You'll be kept in close
confinement until this thing
is cleared up."</p>

<p>Wayne frowned bitterly.
"Yes, sir," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Peter Wayne sat in his cell
in the hospital sector and
stared at the wall in confusion.
What in blazes was going
on? What possible motive
would three enlisted men
have to frame him in this
way? It didn't make any
sense.</p>

<p>Was it possible that he
really <i>had</i> gone off his rocker?
Had he imagined the little
beast under the sand?</p>

<p>He lifted his foot and looked
again at the sole. There it
was: a little pit about an
eighth of an inch deep.</p>

<p>The colonel had explained
it away easily enough, saying
that he might possibly have
stepped on a sharp rock.
Wayne shook his head. He
knew he wasn't nuts. But
what the hell was going on?</p>

<p>There were no answers.
But he knew that the eventual
answer, when it came,
would have something to do
with the mystery of the
<i>Mavis's</i> eight corpses.</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon
when Sherri James came
storming into the hospital
sector. She was wearing a
spacesuit, and she was brandishing
a pass countersigned
by Colonel Petersen himself.
She was determined to enter.</p>

<p>"The medics didn't want to
let me in," she explained.
"But I told them I'd wear a
spacesuit if it would make
them any happier."</p>

<p>"Sherri! What the devil are
you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I just wanted to check on
you," she said. Her voice
sounded oddly distorted coming
over the speaker in the
helmet. "You're supposed to
have blown your wig or something.
Did you?"</p>

<p>"No. Of course not."</p>

<p>"I didn't think so." She unscrewed
her helmet quickly.
"Listen, Peter, there's something
funny going on aboard
this ship."</p>

<p>"I've known that a long
time," he said.</p>

<p>"I think Boggs and those
other two are trying to frame
you," she said, her voice low.
"Do you know of anyone
aboard named Masters?"</p>

<p>"Masters?" Wayne repeated.
"Not that I know of&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I overheard Boggs
talking to one of the other
men. I didn't hear very clearly,
but it sounded as though
he said: 'We've got to get
Moore out and turn him over
to Masters.' Bill Moore is one
of my computermen&mdash;tall,
skinny fellow."</p>

<p>Wayne nodded, frowning.
"Yeah, but who is Masters?
This is the queerest thing I
ever heard of."</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded in the
corridor outside.</p>

<p>"Better put your helmet
on," Wayne advised. "Whoever's
coming might not like
to see you this way."</p>

<p>Quickly, she slipped the
helmet back on. "I don't know
what's going on," she said.
"But I intend to find out."</p>

<hr />

<p>One of the medics entered
the cell without knocking and
came up to Sherri. "You'll
have to go now, Lieutenant,"
he said. "We're going to perform
some tests on the captain
now."</p>

<p>Sherri bristled. "Tests?
What kind of tests?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very serious," the
medic said. "Just a routine
checkup to clarify some
points we're interested in."</p>

<p>"All right," Sherri said.
"You won't find anything the
matter with him." She left.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Captain,"
said the medic politely. He
unlocked the cell door and,
equally politely, drew a
needle-beam pistol. "Don't try
anything, please, sir. I have
my orders."</p>

<p>Silently, Wayne followed
the medic into the lab. Several
other medics were standing
around watching him,
with Stevelman, the head
man, in the back.</p>

<p>"Over this way, Captain,"
Stevelman called.</p>

<p>There was a box sitting on
a table in the middle of the
room. It was full of sand.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, please,
Captain," the medic said tonelessly.</p>

<p>In a sudden flash of insight,
Wayne realized what was in
the box. He thought fast but
moved slowly. He held out his
hand, but just as the medic
took it, he twisted suddenly
away.</p>

<p>His hand flashed out and
grasped the other's wrist in
a steely grip. The medic's fingers
tightened on the needle-beam,
and managed to pull
the trigger. A bright beam
flared briefly against the lab's
plastalloy floor, doing nothing
but scorching it slightly.
Wayne's other hand balled into
a fist and came up hard
against the medic's jaw.</p>

<p>He grabbed the needle-beam
pistol from the collapsing
man's limp hand and had
the other three men covered
before the slugged medic had
finished sagging to the floor.</p>

<p>"All of you! Raise your
hands!"</p>

<p>They paid no attention to
him. Instead of standing
where they were, they began
to move toward him. Wayne
swore and, with a quick flip
of his thumb, turned the
beam down to low power and
pulled the trigger three times
in quick succession.</p>

<p>The three men fell as
though they'd been pole-axed,
knocked out by the low-power
beam.</p>

<p>"The whole ship's gone
crazy," he murmured softly,
looking at the three men
slumped together on the lab
floor. "Stark, staring, raving
nuts."</p>

<p>He took one step and someone
jumped him from behind.
The needle-beam pistol spun
from his hand and slithered
across the floor as Wayne fell
under the impact of the heavy
body. Apparently the whole
Medical Corps was out to
knock him down today.</p>

<p>He twisted rapidly as an
arm encircled his neck, and
rammed an elbow into the
newcomer's midsection. Then
he jerked his head back,
smashing the back of his skull
into his opponent's nose.</p>

<p>The hold around his neck
weakened, and Wayne tore
himself loose from the other's
grasp. He jumped to his feet,
but the other man was a long
way from being unconscious.
A stinging right smashed into
Wayne's mouth, and he felt
the taste of blood. Hastily he
wiped the trickle away with
the back of his hand.</p>

<p>With his nose pouring
blood, Wayne's antagonist
charged in. His eyes burned
with the strange flame that
had been gleaming in Boggs's
face out on the desert in the
valley. He ploughed into
Wayne's stomach with a savage
blow that rocked Wayne
back.</p>

<p>He grunted and drove back
with a flurry of blows. The
other aimed a wild blow at
Wayne's head; Wayne seized
the wrist as the arm flew past
his ear, and twisted, hard.
The medic flipped through the
air and came to rest against
the wall with a brief crunching
impact. He moaned and
then lapsed into silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>Quickly, Wayne grabbed
the gun off the floor and
planted his back to the wall,
looking around for new antagonists.
But there was evidently
no one left who cared
to tangle with him, and the
four medics strewn out on the
floor didn't seem to have much
fight left in them.</p>

<p>Wayne crossed the room in
a couple of strides and bolted
the door. Then he walked over
to the box of sand. If it contained
what he suspected&mdash;</p>

<p>He stepped over to the lab
bench and picked out a long
steel support rod from the
equipment drawer. He placed
the rod gently against the
sand, and pushed downward,
hard. There was a tinny
scream, and a six-inch needle
shot up instantly through the
surface.</p>

<p>"Just what I thought,"
Wayne murmured. "Can you
talk, you nasty little brute?"
He prodded into the sand&mdash;more
viciously this time.
There was a flurry of sand,
and the football-shaped thing
came to the surface, clashing
its teeth and screaming
shrilly.</p>

<p>Wayne cursed. Then he
turned the needle gun back up
to full power and calmly
burned the thing to a crisp.
An odor of singed flesh drifted
up from the ashes on the
sand.</p>

<hr />

<p>He stooped and fumbled in
Stevelman's pocket, pulling
out a ring of keys.</p>

<p>"They better be the right
ones," he told the unconscious
medic. Holstering the needle
gun, he walked over to the
medical stores cabinet, hoping
that the things he needed
would be inside. He knew exactly
what he was facing
now, and what he would have
to do.</p>

<p>He checked over the labels,
peering through the neatly-arranged
racks for the substance
he was searching for.</p>

<p>Finally he picked a large
plastine container filled with
a white, crystalline powder.
Then he selected a couple of
bottles filled with a clear,
faintly yellow liquid, and took
a hypodermic gun from the
rack. He relocked the cabinet.</p>

<p>Suddenly a knock sounded.
He stiffened, sucked in his
breath, and turned to face the
door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he asked
cautiously, trying to counterfeit
Stevelman's voice.</p>

<p>"Harrenburg," said a rumbling
voice. "I'm on guard
duty. Heard some noise coming
from in there a while
back, and thought I'd look in.
Everything all right, Dr.
Stevelman? I mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything's fine, Harrenburg,"
Wayne said, imitating
the medic's thin, dry
voice. "We're running some
tests on Captain Wayne.
They're pretty complicated
affairs, and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt again."</p>

<p>"Sure, sir," the guard said.
"Just a routine check, sir.
Colonel Petersen's orders.
Sorry if I've caused any
trouble, sir."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Wayne
said. "Just go away and let us
continue, will you?"</p>

<p>There was the sound of the
guard's footsteps retreating
down the corridor. Wayne
counted to ten and turned
back to the things he had
taken from the cabinet.</p>

<p>The bottles of liquid and
the hypo gun went into his
belt pouch. He tucked the big
bottle of white powder under
his left arm and cautiously
unbolted and opened the door.
There was no sign of anyone
in the corridor. <i>Good</i>, he
thought. It was a lucky thing
Harrenburg had blundered
along just then, and not two
minutes later.</p>

<p>He stepped outside the
Medic Section and locked the
door behind him with the key
he'd taken from Stevelman.
After turning the needle gun
back to low power again in
order to keep from killing
anyone, he started on tiptoe
toward the stairway that led
into the bowels of the ship.</p>

<p>After about ten paces, he
saw a shadow on the stairway,
and cowered in a dark
recess while two crewmen
passed, talking volubly. Once
they were gone, he came out
and continued on his way.</p>

<p>It took quite a while to get
where he was going, since it
involved hiding and ducking
two or three more times along
the way, but he finally reached
the big compartment where
the water repurifiers were.
He climbed up the ladder to
the top of the reserve tank,
opened the hatch, and emptied
the contents of the jar into
the ship's water supply.</p>

<p>"That ought to do it," he
said to himself. Smiling, he
carefully smashed the jar and
dropped the fragments down
the waste chute. He surveyed
his handiwork for a moment,
then turned and headed back.</p>

<p>He hadn't been seen going
down, and he didn't want to
be seen going out. If anyone
even suspected that he had
tampered with the water supply,
all they would have to do
would be to run the water
through the purifiers. That
would undo everything Wayne
had been carefully preparing.</p>

<hr />

<p>He made his way safely
back up to the main deck and
headed through the quiet ship
toward the airlock. He wasn't
so lucky this time; a guard
saw him.</p>

<p>"Where you goin', Captain?"
the guard demanded,
starting to lift his gun.
"Seems to me you ought to be
in the brig, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wayne made no reply. He
brought his gun up in a rapid
motion and beamed the man
down. The guard toppled, a
hurt expression on his face.</p>

<p>Wayne raced to the airlock.
He didn't bother with a spacesuit&mdash;not
<i>now</i>, when he knew
that the air was perfectly
harmless outside. He opened
the inner door, closed it, and
opened the outer door.</p>

<p>Then, grinning gleefully,
he pressed the button that
would start the pumping
cycle. The outer door started
to close automatically, and
Wayne just barely managed
to get outside and onto the
ladder before it clanged shut.
As soon as the great hatch
had sealed itself, the pumps
started exhausting the air
from the airlock. No one could
open the doors until the
pumping cycle was over.</p>

<p>He climbed down the ladder
and began walking over
toward the western wall. He
would have to keep away
from the ship for a while, and
the rocks were as good a place
as any to hide out.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was dark. Fomalhaut
had set, leaving the moonless
planet in utter blackness,
broken only by the cold gleam
of the stars. The lights
streaming from the portholes
of the <i>Lord Nelson</i> gave a
small degree of illumination
to the valley.</p>

<p>The valley. It was spread
out before him, calm and
peaceful, rippling dunes of
sand curling out toward the
mountains. The valley, he
knew, was a betrayer&mdash;calm
and quiet above, alive with an
army of hideous vermin a few
feet below its surface.</p>

<p>He started to walk, and
moistened his lips. He knew
he was going to get awfully
thirsty in the next few hours,
but there was not the slightest
help for it. There hadn't been
any way to carry water from
the ship.</p>

<p>"I can wait," he told himself.
He stared back at the
circular bulk of the <i>Lord Nelson</i>
behind him, and his fingers
trembled a little. He had
known, when he joined the
Corps, that space was full of
traps like this one&mdash;but this
was the first time he had actually
experienced anything
like this. It was foul.</p>

<p>Something slammed into
his boot sole, and this time
Wayne knew what it was.</p>

<p>"Persistent, aren't you!"
He jerked his foot up. This
monster hadn't stuck as the
other one had, but he saw the
tip of the needle-beak thrashing
around wildly in the loose
sand. Wayne thumbed the
gun up to full power, and
there was a piercing shriek
as the gun burned into the
sand. There was a sharp
shrill sound, and the odor of
something burning. He spat.</p>

<p>The little beasts must be all
over the floor of the valley!
Scurrying frantically, like
blood-red giant crabs, sidling
up and down beneath the valley,
searching upward for
things to strike at. How they
must hate his metamagnetic
boots, he thought!</p>

<p>He kept on walking, expecting
to feel the impact of
another thrust momentarily,
but he was not molested
again. <i>They must be getting
wise</i>, he thought. <i>They know
they can't get through my
boots, and so they're leaving
me alone. That way they don't
call attention to themselves.</i></p>

<p>A new, more chilling question
struck him:</p>

<p><i>Just how smart are they?</i></p>

<p>He had made it to the wall
and was climbing up the
treacherous slope when the
airlock door opened, and
someone stood outlined in the
bright circle of light that cut
into the inky blackness. An
amplified voice filled the valley
and ricocheted back off
the walls of the mountains,
casting eerie echoes down on
the lone man on the desert.</p>

<p>"CAPTAIN WAYNE!
THIS IS COLONEL PETERSEN
SPEAKING. DON'T
YOU REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE A SICK MAN?
YOU MAY DIE OUT
THERE. COME BACK.
THAT'S AN ORDER, CAPTAIN.
REPEAT: COME
BACK. THAT'S AN
ORDER!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid an order from
you just doesn't hold much
weight for me right now,
Colonel," Wayne said quietly,
to himself. Silently he
went on climbing the escarpment,
digging into the rough
rock.</p>

<p>He kept on climbing until
he found the niche for which
he had been heading. He
dragged himself in and sat
down, as comfortably as possible.
He began to wait.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dawn came in less than
three hours, as Fomalhaut
burst up over the horizon and
exploded in radiance over the
valley. With dawn came a
patrol of men, slinking surreptitiously
across the valley,
probably with orders to bring
him in. Wayne was ensconced
comfortably in his little rock
niche, hidden from the men in
the valley below, but with a
perfect view of everything
that went on. The wind
whistled around the cliffs,
ceaselessly moaning a tuneless
song. He felt like standing
up and shouting wildly,
"Here I am! Here I am!" but
he repressed the perverse
urge.</p>

<p>The patrol group stood in a
small clump in the valley below,
seemingly waiting for
something. Moments passed,
and then it became apparent
what that something was.
Hollingwood, the metallurgist,
appeared, dragging with
him the detector. They were
going to look for Captain
Wayne with it, just as they
had searched out the double-nucleus
beryllium.</p>

<p>Wayne frowned. It was a
possibility he hadn't thought
about. They could easily detect
the metal in his boots!
And he didn't dare take them
off; he'd never make it back
across that hellish stretch of
sand without them. He glanced
uneasily at his watch. <i>How
much longer do I have to keep
evading them?</i> he wondered.
It was a wearing task.</p>

<p>It looked as though it would
be much too long.</p>

<p>The muzzle of the detector
began to swing back and forth
slowly and precisely, covering
the valley inch by inch. He
heard their whispered consultations
drifting up from below,
though he couldn't make
out what they were saying.</p>

<hr />

<p>They finished with the valley,
evidently concluding he
wasn't there, and started
searching the walls. Wayne
decided it was time to get out
while the getting was good.
He crawled slowly out of the
niche and wriggled along the
escarpment, heading south,
keeping low so the men in the
valley wouldn't see him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he couldn't
see them either. He kept moving,
hoping they wouldn't
spot him with the detector.
He wished he had the metamagnetic
hand grapples with
him. For one thing, the sharp
rock outcroppings sliced
his hands like so much meat.
For another, he could have
dropped the grapples somewhere
as a decoy.</p>

<p><i>Oh, well, you can't think of
everything</i>, Wayne told himself.
He glanced at his watch.
How long was it going to
take?</p>

<p>He heard the scrape of
boot leather on a rock somewhere
ahead of him. He
glanced up sharply, seeing
nothing, and scowled. They
had spotted him.</p>

<p>They were laying a trap.</p>

<p>Cautiously, he climbed over
a huge boulder, making no
sound. There was one man
standing behind it, waiting,
apparently, for Wayne to step
around into view. He peered
down, trying to see who it
was. It seemed to be Hollingwood,
the dignified, austere
metallurgist.</p>

<p>Wayne smiled grimly, picked
up a heavy rock, and dropped
it straight down, square
on the man's helmet. The
plexalloy rang like a bell
through the clear early-morning
air, and the man dropped
to his knees, dazed by the
shock.</p>

<hr />

<p>Knowing he had just a moment
to finish the job, Wayne
pushed off against the side of
the rock and plummeted
down, landing neatly on the
metallurgist's shoulders. The
man reeled and fell flat.
Wayne spun him over and delivered
a hard punch to the
solar plexus. "Sorry, Dave,"
he said softly. The metallurgist
gasped and curled up in a
tight ball. Wayne stood up. It
was brutal, but it was the only
place you could hit a man
wearing a space helmet.</p>

<p><i>One down</i>, Wayne thought.
<i>Fifty-eight to go.</i> He was
alone against the crew&mdash;and,
for all he knew, against all
fifty-nine of them.</p>

<p>Hollingwood groaned and
stretched. Wayne bent and,
for good measure, took off the
man's helmet and tapped him
none too gently on the skull.</p>

<p>There was the sound of
footsteps, the harsh <i>chitch-chitch</i>
of feet against the
rock. "He's up that way," he
heard a deep voice boom.</p>

<p>That meant the others had
heard the rock hitting Hollingwood's
plexalloy helmet.
They were coming toward
him.</p>

<p>Wayne sprang back defensively
and glanced around. He
hoped there were only five of
them, that the rule of six was
still being maintained. Otherwise
things could become
really complicated, as they
hunted him relentlessly
through the twisted gulleys.</p>

<p>He hated to have to knock
out too many of the men; it
just meant more trouble later.
Still, there was no help for it,
if he wanted there to be any
later. He thought of the
bleached bones of the crew of
the <i>Mavis</i>, and shuddered.</p>

<p>It was something of an advantage
not to be wearing a
helmet. Even with the best of
acoustical systems, hearing
inside a helmet tended to be
distorted and dimmed. The
men couldn't hear him as well
as he could hear them. And
since they couldn't hear themselves
too well, they made a
little more noise than he did.</p>

<p>A space boot came into
view around a big rock, and
Wayne aimed his needle-beam
at the spot where the man's
head would appear.</p>

<p>When the head came
around the rock, Wayne fired.
The man dropped instantly.
<i>Sorry, friend</i>, Wayne apologized
mentally. <i>Two down.
Fifty-seven to go.</i> The odds
were still pretty heavy.</p>

<p>He knew he had to move
quickly now; the others had
seen the man drop, and by
now they should have a pretty
good idea exactly where
Wayne was.</p>

<p>He picked up a rock and
lobbed it over a nearby boulder,
then started moving cat-like
in the other direction. He
climbed up onto another boulder
and watched two men
move away from him. They
were stepping warily, their
beam guns in their hands.
Wayne wiped away a bead of
perspiration, aimed carefully,
and squeezed the firing stud
twice.</p>

<p><i>Four down. Fifty-five to go.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>A moment later, something
hissed near his ear. Without
waiting, he spun and rolled
off the boulder, landing cat-like
on his feet. Another
crewman was standing on top
of a nearby boulder. Wayne
began to sweat; this pursuit
seemed to be indefinitely prolonged,
and it was beginning
to look unlikely that he could
avoid them forever.</p>

<p>He had dropped his pistol
during the fall; it was wedged
between a couple of rocks
several feet away.</p>

<p>He heard someone call: "I
got him. He fell off the rock.
We'll take him back down below."</p>

<p>Then another voice&mdash;ominously.
"He won't mind. He'll
be glad we did it for him&mdash;afterwards."</p>

<p>"I'll go get him," said the
first voice. The man stepped
around the side of the boulder&mdash;just
in time to have a
hard-pitched rock come
thunking into his midsection.</p>

<p>"Oof!" he grunted, took a
couple of steps backwards,
and collapsed.</p>

<p><i>Five down. Fifty-four to
go.</i> It could go on forever this
way.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked
the man who had replied
to the first one with those
chilling words.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Wayne, in
a fair imitation of the prostrate
crewman's voice. "He's
heavy. Come help me."</p>

<p>Then he reached down and
picked up the fallen man's
beam gun. He took careful
aim.</p>

<p>When the sixth man stepped
around the rock, he fired.
The beam went wide of the
mark, slowing the other
down, and Wayne charged
forward. He pounded two
swift punches into the amazed
crewman, who responded
with a woozy, wild blow.
Wayne ducked and let the
fist glide past his ear, then
came in hard with a solid
body-blow and let the man
sag to the ground. He took a
deep breath.</p>

<p><i>Six down and only fifty-three
to go.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>He crawled back to the
edge of the precipice and
peered down into the valley.
There was no one to be seen.
It was obvious that Colonel
Petersen was still enforcing
the six-man rule.</p>

<p>As he watched, he saw the
airlock door open. A spacesuited
figure scrambled down
the ladder and sprinted across
the deadly sand of the valley
floor.</p>

<p>It was Sherri! Wayne held
his breath, expecting at any
moment that one of the little
monsters beneath the sand
would sink its vicious needle
upward into Sherri's foot.
But her stride never faltered.</p>

<p>As she neared the precipice,
another figure appeared at
the airlock door and took aim
with a gun.</p>

<p>Wayne thumbed his own
needle-beam pistol up to full
and fired hastily at the distant
figure. At that distance, even
the full beam would only
stun. The figure collapsed
backwards into the airlock,
and Wayne grinned in satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Seven down. Fifty-two to
go.</i></p>

<p>He kept an eye on the airlock
door and a finger on his
firing stud, waiting to see if
anyone else would come out.
No one else did.</p>

<p>As soon as Sherri was safely
up to the top of the precipice,
Wayne ran to meet her.</p>

<p>"Sherri! What the devil did
you come out here for?"</p>

<p>"I had to see you," she said,
panting for breath. "If you'll
come back to the ship before
they beam you down, we can
prove to Colonel Petersen that
you're all right. We can show
them that the Masters&mdash;"</p>

<p>She realized suddenly what
she said and uttered a little
gasp. She had her pistol out
before the surprised Wayne
could move.</p>

<p>He stared coldly at the pistol,
thinking bitterly that this
was a hell of a way for it all
to finish. "So they got you
too," he said. "That little display
at the airlock was a
phony. You were sent out
here to lure me back into the
ship. Just another Judas."</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. "That's
right," she said. "We all have
to go to the Masters. It is&mdash;it&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes glazed, and she
swayed on her feet. The pistol
wavered and swung in a
feeble spiral, no longer pointed
at Wayne. Gently, he took
it from her nerveless fingers
and caught her supple body
as she fell.</p>

<p>He wiped his forehead dry.
Up above, the sun was climbing
toward the top of the sky,
and its beams raked the planet
below, pouring down heat.</p>

<hr />

<p>He glanced at his wristwatch
while waiting for his
nerves to stop tingling. Sherri
must have been the last one&mdash;the
drug must have taken
effect at last, and not a moment
too soon. He decided to
wait another half hour before
he tried to get into the spaceship,
just the same.</p>

<p>The huge globe of the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> stood forlornly in the
center of the valley. The airlock
door stayed open; no one
tried to close it.</p>

<p>Wayne's mouth was growing
dry; his tongue felt like
sandpaper. Nevertheless, he
forced himself to sit quietly,
watching the ship closely for
the full half hour, before he
picked up Sherri, tied his
rope around her waist, and
lowered her to the valley
floor. Then he wandered
around the rocks, collecting
the six unconscious men, and
did the same for them.</p>

<p>He carried them all, one by
one, across the sand, burning
a path before him with the
needle beam.</p>

<p>Long before he had finished
his task, the sand was churning
loathsomely with the
needles of hundreds and
thousands of the monstrous
little beasts. They were trying
frantically to bring down
the being that was so effectively
thwarting their plans,
jabbing viciously with their
upthrust beaks. The expanse
of sand that was the valley
looked like a pincushion, with
the writhing needles ploughing
through the ground one
after another. Wayne kept the
orifice of his beam pistol hot
as he cut his way back and
forth from the base of the
cliff to the ship.</p>

<p>When he had dumped the
seven unconscious ones all inside
the airlock, he closed the
outer door and opened the inner
one. There was not a
sound from within.</p>

<p><i>Fifty-nine down</i>, he
thought, <i>and none to go</i>.</p>

<p>He entered the ship and
dashed down the winding
staircase to the water purifiers
to change the water in the
reservoir tanks. Thirsty as he
was, he was not going to take
a drink until the water had
been cleared of the knockout
drug he had dropped into the
tanks.</p>

<p>After that came the laborious
job of getting everyone
in the ship strapped into their
bunks for the takeoff. It took
the better part of an hour to
get all sixty of them up&mdash;they
had fallen all over the ship&mdash;and
nestled in the acceleration
cradles. When the job
was done, he went to the main
control room and set the
autopilot to lift the spaceship
high into the ionosphere.</p>

<p>Then, sighting carefully on
the valley far below, he dropped
a flare bomb.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, little monsters,"
he said exultantly.</p>

<p>For a short space of time,
nothing happened. Then the
viewplate was filled with a
deadly blue-white glare. Unlike
an ordinary atomic bomb,
the flare bomb would not explode
violently; it simply
burned, sending out a brilliant
flare of deadly radiation
that would crisp all life
dozens of feet below the
ground.</p>

<p>He watched the radiation
blazing below. Then it began
to die down, and when the
glare cleared away, all was
quiet below.</p>

<p>The valley was dead.</p>

<p>When it was all over,
Wayne took the hypodermic
gun from his pouch, filled it
with the anti-hypnotic drug
that he had taken from the
medical cabinet, and began
to make his rounds. He fired
a shot into each and every
one aboard. He had no way of
knowing who had been injected
by the small monsters and
who had not, so he was taking
no chances.</p>

<p>Then he went to the colonel's
room. He wanted to be
there when the Commanding
Officer awoke.</p>

<hr />

<p>The entire crew of the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> was gathered in the
big mess hall. Wayne stared
down at the tired, frightened
faces of the puzzled people
looking up at him, and continued
his explanation.</p>

<p>"Those of you who were
under the control of the monsters
know what it was like.
They had the ability to inject
a hypnotic drug into a human
being through a normal space
boot with those stingers of
theirs. The drug takes effect
so fast that the victim hardly
has any idea of what has happened
to him."</p>

<p>"But why do they do it?"
It was Hollingwood, the metallurgist,
looking unhappy
with a tremendous bruise on
his head where Wayne had
clobbered him.</p>

<p>"Why does a wasp sting a
spider? It doesn't kill the
spider, it simply stuns it. That
way, the spider remains alive
and fresh so that young wasps
can feed upon it at their leisure."</p>

<p>Wayne glanced over to his
right. "Lieutenant Jervis,
you've been under the effect
of the drug longer than any
of us. Would you explain what
<i>really</i> happened when the
<i>Mavis</i> landed?"</p>

<p>The young officer stood up.
He was pale and shaken, but
his voice was clear and
steady.</p>

<p>"Just about the same thing
that almost happened here,"
Jervis said. "We all walked
around the valley floor and
got stung one at a time. The
things did it so quietly that
none of us knew what was going
on until we got hit ourselves.
When we had all been
enslaved, we were ready to
do their bidding. They can't
talk, but they can communicate
by means of nerve messages
when that needle is
stuck into you."</p>

<p>Nearly half the crew
nodded in sympathy. Wayne
studied them, wondering what
it must have been like. They
<i>knew</i>; he could only guess.</p>

<p>"Naturally," Jervis went
on, "those who have already
been injected with the drug
try to get others injected.
When everyone aboard the
<i>Mavis</i> had been stung, they
ordered me to take the ship
home and get another load of
Earthmen. Apparently they
like our taste. I had to obey;
I was completely under their
power. You know what it's
like."</p>

<p>"And what happened to the
others&mdash;the eight men you
left behind?" asked Colonel
Petersen.</p>

<p>Jervis clenched his teeth
bitterly. "They just laid down
on the sand&mdash;and waited."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" Sherri said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jervis fell silent. Wayne
was picturing the sight, and
knew everyone else was, too&mdash;the
sight of hordes of carnivorous
little aliens burrowing
up through the sand
and approaching the eight
Earthmen who lay there,
alive but helpless. Approaching
them&mdash;and beginning to
feed.</p>

<p>Just when the atmosphere
began to grow too depressing,
Wayne decided to break the
spell. "I'd like to point out
that the valley's been completely
cauterized," he said.
"The aliens have been wiped
out. And I propose to lead a
mission out to reconnoitre for
the double-nucleus beryllium."</p>

<p>He looked around. "MacPherson?
Boggs? Manetti?
You three want to start over
where we left off the last
time?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Boggs came up to
him. "Sir, I want you to understand
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, Boggs," Wayne
said. "Let's forget all about
it. There's work to be done."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I misjudged you,
Wayne. If it hadn't been for
your quick action, this crew
would have gone the way of
the <i>Mavis</i>."</p>

<p>"Just luck, Colonel,"
Wayne said. "If it hadn't been
for those heavy-soled climbing
boots, I'd probably be lying
out there with the rest of
you right now."</p>

<p>Colonel Petersen grinned.
"Thanks to your boots, then."</p>

<p>Wayne turned to his team
of three. "Let's get moving,
fellows. We've wasted enough
time already."</p>

<p>"Do we need spacesuits,
sir?" Manetti asked.</p>

<p>"No, Manetti. The air's
perfectly fine out there,"
Wayne said. "But I'd suggest
you wear your climbing
boots." He grinned. "You
never can tell when they'll
come in handy."</p>
